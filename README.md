# Cisco-Retail-Chain-Network-System
This project was developed in Cisco Packet Tracer as a simulation of a real-world network for a retail store chain. The scenario involves a centralized Headquarters (HQ) connected to five branch offices, each of which is independently functional but interconnected to support centralized services and inter-office communication.
